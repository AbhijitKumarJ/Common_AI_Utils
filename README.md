# Common_AI_Utils

There are two implementations of AI utilities:

## First Implementation - Client only with no backend server

This one is totally client based without requiring a backend server, you can download and run the index.html as starting point on localhost directly.

This implementation is meant to work only on client Side without backend.

Just use the settings icon to set your Open Router API Key and you can use text analysis and mind-map features.

### This is kept in Web branch


## Second implementation: With backend

Requires to run with npm install and npm run dev after downloading. Also, need to set .env.local file with contents from sample.env.local.
